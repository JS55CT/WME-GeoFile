# GeoGMLer

GeoGMLer is a JavaScript library designed to efficiently convert GML (Geography Markup Language) data into GeoJSON format. It supports a wide range of GML geometries, making it ideal for integrating GML spatial data into web mapping applications and geographic data visualization tools.

## Overview

GeoGMLer offers a comprehensive API to parse GML files and convert them into a GeoJSON `FeatureCollection`. It is suitable for use in geographic data visualization and web mapping applications, providing support for various geometry types and coordinate reference systems.

## Features

- **Convert GML to GeoJSON**: Supports conversion of Points, LineStrings, Polygons, and complex structures like `gml:MultiCurve` and `gml:MultiSurface` into GeoJSON.
- **CRS Support**: Handles coordinate reference systems by extracting CRS information from GML and utilizing it during conversion.
- **Robust XML Parsing**: Utilizes DOMParser for efficient parsing and handling of XML data, ensuring accurate extraction of geographical features and attributes.
- **Geometry Processing**: Parses and processes both simple and complex geometries, including multi-geometries.
- **No External Dependencies**: Lightweight and easy to integrate into various projects without requiring additional libraries.

## Usage

To use GeoGMLer, create an instance of `GeoGMLer` and utilize its methods to perform conversions from GML strings to GeoJSON objects.

### Example

```javascript
var geoGMLer = new GeoGMLer(); // Create a new instance of GeoGMLer

// Sample GML data input
const gmlData = `...GML data string...`;

// Parse the GML data
const { xmlDoc, crsName } = geoGMLer.read(gmlData);

// Convert to GeoJSON
const geoJson = geoGMLer.toGeoJSON({ xmlDoc, crsName });

console.log(geoJson);
```

## Key Methods

- read(gmlText): Parses a GML string into an XML Document and extracts the CRS using DOMParser.
- toGeoJSON({ xmlDoc, crsName }): Converts a parsed XML Document along with CRS information into a GeoJSON FeatureCollection.
- getFeatureEleProperties(featureEle): Extracts properties from a GML feature element.
- processMultiSurface(multiSurfaceElement, crsName): Processes gml:MultiSurface elements to extract polygon data.
- processMultiCurve(multiCurveElement, crsName): Processes gml:MultiCurve elements to extract line string data.
